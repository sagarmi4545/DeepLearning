## Overview

This Deep Learning course is designed to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of deep learning concepts, methodologies, and practical applications. Through a combination of theoretical knowledge and hands-on coding exercises, learners will gain the skills necessary to tackle real-world problems using deep learning techniques.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into the following modules:

1. **Introduction to Deep Learning**
   - Overview of Neural Networks
   - Basic Building Blocks: Neurons, Layers, and Activations

2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
   - Image Recognition
   - Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models

3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
   - Sequential Data Analysis
   - Natural Language Processing (NLP) Applications

4. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
   - Image Generation
   - Applications in Data Augmentation

## Prerequisites

Participants are expected to have a basic understanding of:
- Python programming language
- Linear algebra and calculus concepts
- Fundamentals of machine learning

Additionally, familiarity with deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch is beneficial but not mandatory.
